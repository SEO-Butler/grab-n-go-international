# Claude Code Configuration

This file contains configuration and instructions for Claude Code to work effectively with this project.

## Project Overview

This is a Vite + React + Tailwind CSS project for the **Grab 'n Go International** event landing page. It features animated sections, ticket booking functionality, and a fully configurable event system.

## Development Commands

### Primary Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes linting)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Testing & Quality Assurance
Before any deployment or major changes, always run:
```bash
npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Configuration System

### Event Configuration (`src/config/event.js`)

This file controls all event-specific content. Update this file to customize:

- **Branding**: Event name, colors, logo
- **Content**: Titles, descriptions, dates, locations
- **Pricing**: Ticket types, prices, features
- **Contact**: Email, phone, social media

Example customization:
```javascript
export const eventConfig = {
  branding: {
    name: "Your Event Name",
    themeColorFrom: '#your-color',
    // ...
  },
  sections: {
    hero: {
      title: 'YOUR EVENT\nTITLE',
      subtitle: 'Event description',
      date: 'EVENT DATE',
      location: 'EVENT LOCATION'
    },
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Analytics Integration

The project includes analytics tracking stubs in `src/lib/analytics.js`. To enable:

1. **Google Analytics 4**: Uncomment and configure `gtag()` calls
2. **Meta Pixel**: Uncomment and configure `fbq()` calls
3. **Custom Analytics**: Add your endpoint calls

Tracked events:
- `hero_cta_click` - Hero button clicks
- `menu_click` - Navigation clicks
- `open_booking` - Ticket booking initiated
- `submit_booking_success` - Successful form submission
- `submit_booking_error` - Form submission errors
- `maps_click` - Location map interactions
- `maps_directions_click` - Directions button clicks
- `final_cta_click` - Final CTA clicks

## Accessibility Features

The application includes:
- **Keyboard navigation** with proper focus management
- **Screen reader support** with ARIA labels and roles
- **Semantic HTML** structure with proper heading hierarchy
- **Focus indicators** and skip links
- **Mobile-friendly** touch targets

## Form Validation

The ticket booking form uses:
- **React Hook Form** for form state management
- **Zod** for schema validation (ready to implement)
- **Real-time validation** feedback
- **Accessibility** compliance

## Maps Integration

Location features use Google Maps:
- **Search URLs** for viewing locations
- **Directions URLs** for navigation
- **Coordinate display** for GPS apps
- **Mobile-friendly** map interactions

## Styling System

Built with:
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Icons** for iconography
- **Responsive design** patterns

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Form submission currently uses a test webhook URL
- Analytics tracking is stubbed (needs real implementation)
- Social media links are placeholder
- Images use external URLs (consider hosting locally)

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

1. ✅ Update `src/config/event.js` with real event data
2. ✅ Configure analytics in `src/lib/analytics.js`
3. ✅ Update form submission endpoint in `TicketBookingForm.jsx`
4. ✅ Replace placeholder social media links in Footer
5. ✅ Test all functionality with `npm run preview`
6. ✅ Ensure `npm run build` passes without warnings

## Performance Notes

- Bundle size: ~440KB JS, ~25KB CSS (gzipped: ~120KB JS, ~5KB CSS)
- Uses code splitting and tree shaking
- Optimized animations with `will-change` and transforms
- Lazy loading for heavy components recommended

## Browser Support

Tested and supported:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Environment Variables

For production, consider adding:
```
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your-ga-id
VITE_FORM_ENDPOINT=your-form-endpoint
VITE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-key
```

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails**: Check ESLint errors with `npm run lint`
**Animations not working**: Verify Framer Motion version compatibility
**Form not submitting**: Check network tab for endpoint errors
**Maps not loading**: Verify coordinates in config are valid

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- TypeScript for better type safety
- Unit tests with Vitest
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Image optimization and local hosting
- Progressive Web App features
- Multi-language support
